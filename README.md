# TodoDemoApp

This is a simple React-based todo application. The todos are stored in your browser's local storage so they persist across sessions.

## Usage

Open `public/index.html` in a web browser. You can add and delete todo items. They will automatically be saved.

No additional build steps or tools are required because React and Babel are loaded via CDNs.
